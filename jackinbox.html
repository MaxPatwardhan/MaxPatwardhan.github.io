                    <h1>Jack-In-Box Lagrangian Physics Simulation</h1>
                    <h3>Programmed and Simulated in Python</h3>
                </header>
                <p>In this project, I used Lagrangian physics to simulate a "Jack-In-Box". The jack experiences impacts against
                    the walls of the box, which is under the force of gravity as well as an external forcing functions.
                    The jack is subject to only the force of gravity. The external forces applied to the box are defined as follows:<br>

                    The force in the \(y\)-direction:
                    \[
                    f_{y,\text{box}} = 4 m g + 0.5 k \sin(2 \pi t)
                    \]

                    The force in the \(x\)-direction:
                    \[
                    f_{x,\text{box}} = 0.5 k \sin(2 \pi t)
                    \]

                    The torque about the center of mass:
                    \[
                    f_{\theta,\text{box}} = k \sin(\pi t)
                    \]
                </p>
                <p>Note that \(m,k\), and \(t\) represent mass, the moment of inertia of the box, and time respectively.</p>

                <p>The frames and coordinate transforms seen in Figure 1 were implemented in the 
                    <i>Definition of Variables, Constants, and Transforms</i> section. A function called "se3sym" was used to take \(x\), \(y\),
                     and \(\theta\) data in order to create SE3 transformation matrices. These matrices take the form:</p>

                <p>
                    \[
                    t(x,y,\theta)_{jack,box} =
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        \cos{(\theta)} & -\sin{(\theta)} & 0 & x \\ 
                        \sin{(\theta)} & \cos{(\theta)} & 0 & y \\ 
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    \]
                </p>
            
                <p>From Equation 1, the configuration variables \(x_j\), \(y_j\), \(\theta_j\), \(x_b\), \(y_b\), and \(\theta_b\) 
                    were used to create transforms from the world-frame to the jack and box frame respectively. From here, the location of each
                     wall and jack-arm was defined using another coordinate transform of the form:</p>
            
                <p>
                    \[
                    t(\pm l)_{arm,wall} =
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        1 & 0 & 0 & \pm l \\ 
                        0 & 1 & 0 & \pm l \\ 
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    \]
                </p>
            
                <p>Thus the product of Equation 1 and Equation 2 with the desired length, \(l\), will yield a transform to a given jack edge or wall.
                     An example is given below:</p>
            
                <p>
                    \[
                    t_{j1} =
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        \cos{(\theta_j)} & -\sin{(\theta_j)} & 0 & x_j \\ 
                        \sin{(\theta_j)} & \cos{(\theta_j)} & 0 & y_j \\ 
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        1 & 0 & 0 & l_{jack} \\ 
                        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    =
                    \begin{bmatrix}
                        \cos{(\theta_j)} & -\sin{(\theta_j)} & 0 & x_j + l_{jack} \\ 
                        \sin{(\theta_j)} & \cos{(\theta_j)} & 0 & y_j \\ 
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
                        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
                    \end{bmatrix}
                    \]
                </p>
            
                <p>After the transformation to each element of the jack and box was defined, the Lagrangian could be calculated and solved using 
                    the body velocity, inertia tensor, and the height of each element. The moments of inertia were easily calculated as each element 
                    was treated as a uniform density rectangle or circle. A matrix containing external forces to the box was defined, and the 
                    Euler-Lagrange equations were formulated. Once solved, they were translated into numerical solutions using lambdify. 
                    The system was simulated with multiple types of external constraint forces. In each simulation, the force of gravity on the 
                    box was counteracted with an equal and opposite external force. Beyond that, sinusoidal forces in each degree of freedom were 
                    modeled on the box.</p>
            
                <p>After modeling the standard Euler-Lagrange equations, impact conditions were defined for each end of the jack to each wall. 
                    The sixteen impact conditions were defined by finding the transformation between each wall and each end of the jack; an 
                    individual \(\phi\) was defined for each impact. Next, the Hamiltonian was calculated in order to formulate the impact equations. 
                    Two dummy-variable dictionaries were defined for pre/post impact definitions of velocity. The impact update equations were solved
                     with \(\tau^+\) and \(\tau^-\) variables substituted, and were finally appended to a list. From this point, an impact test 
                     function was defined. This function takes in the configuration of the system, and tests to see if the impact conditions are 
                     satisfied. The function returns a boolean depending on whether or not a condition is satisfied, as well as the index of the
                      condition satisfied. This index was then passed to the impact update function, which takes the impact equation index and 
                      the system state, and evaluates the specified solution. The function returns the updated velocities for further simulation. 
                      These operations are carried out for the specified time interval, populating a trajectory vector. This vector is then passed 
                      to the animation function, which makes use of the previously described transformations in order to draw the lines for 
                      animation.</p>
