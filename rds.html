                <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        This fast-paced project, developed as part of Northwestern University's selective capstone program in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory, 
                        focused on designing and implementing a sophisticated haptic-robot telemanipulation system. Argonne National Laboratory desired a system that would allow 
                        their chemists to remotely work with radioactive materials, necessitating a highly precise-yet-strong haptic/robot system. Our solution enables users to control a robotic finger and thumb
                        using a haptic exoskeleton. I drove the rapid, full-stack design and development of the project's electronics, ultimately providing a highly reliable and easily integrable solution.

                        <h2>System Overview</h2>
                            <p> 
                                Our team meticulously designed the mechanical, electrical, and software components of this project within just five months, ultimately developing a novel approach 
                                to human-robot devices that offers distinct advantages over existing systems. Unlike other haptic or robotic hand systems that struggle to accurately translate forces 
                                between the robot and the userâ€”often causing rigid objects grasped by the robot to feel squishy to the operatorâ€”our design ensures precise force feedback. This 
                                precision is crucial when operators need to work with delicate equipment to manipulate small objects. <br>
        
                                Traditional power transfer solutions fall short in this application: gear-train systems exhibit noticeable backlash, linkages are overly complex and hinder a low-profile 
                                design, and pneumatic or hydraulic systems cannot match the force exerted by the human hand. To overcome these challenges, we chose a cable-driven design powered by 
                                brushless DC motors positioned near the operator's palm. This approach eliminates system play while maintaining a slender and robust mechanical structure. The use of 
                                cables enabled us to focus on a high-gain controller, providing operators with an accurate representation of the robotâ€™s interactions.<br>
                                
                                The system comprises distinct haptic and robotic components for both fingers and thumbs, each featuring two actuated degrees of freedom and a third passive degree of 
                                freedom. This configuration allows for natural and precise motion while ensuring the design remains feasible within the projectâ€™s timeframe. <br> 
                                
                                I developed a modular electrical system for these robotic and haptic devices, creating three different PCBs to manage power, communication, and control for each subsystem. The 'power board' 
                                supplies and regulates power across four distinct domains, ensuring stable voltage with multiple user and system protections. The 'data board' supports real-time communication 
                                through a dual CAN bus architecture, controlled by a Teensy microcontroller and equipped with fault-tolerant transceivers for both intra-system and inter-system communication. 
                                High-resolution magnetic encoders deliver essential feedback for motion control, while integrated safety mechanisms, including emergency stops and system monitoring, protect both 
                                the operator and the hardware.

                <h2>Robot Finger</h2>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="images/rds/mechanical/rfinger.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 60%;" />

                <p>
                    The robot finger subsystem is engineered to closely replicate human finger curling motions, featuring two actively actuated joints that deliver smooth, natural articulation. 
                    Rather than relying on a traditional gear train, it uses a pulley-driven transmission with a 4:1 ratio at each joint, enhancing torque delivery while maintaining a compact profile. 
                    High-performance Maxon EC 45 flat motors supply the requisite torque density without adding bulk. To ensure stability under load, stainless steel cables are tensioned using 
                    simple screws and nuts, and magnetic encoders provide precise positional data for fine-tuned control. Structural components are fabricated through both water jet cutting and CNC 
                    milling for accuracy and durability. While performance and torque efficiency meet design goals, refining linkage interfaces and streamlining the assembly process remains an ongoing priority.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Robot Thumb</h2>
                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/rds/mechanical/rthumb.png" alt="" /></span>
                    Similar to the robot finger, the robot thumb is tailored to replicate the dexterity and form factor of the human thumb, offering two actuated degrees of freedom to produce both 'waggle' (abduction/adduction: motion 
                    that moves the thumb away from the palm) and 'curl' 
                    (flexion/extension: curling or extending your thumb) motions. The 'waggle' joint operates at a 7.33:1 transmission ratio, driven by Maxon ECX Torque 22XL motors for steady, responsive motion. In contrast, the 'curl' 
                    movement uses a 7.94:1 ratio powered by Maxon EC 45 Flat motors, chosen for their compact design and strong torque-to-size ratio. Multiple cable wraps, tensioning blocks, and 
                    CNC-machined pulleys work together to maintain tension. High-precision machining, including turning and milling, ensures tight tolerances and 
                    secure mechanical coupling. Similar to the finger, there are still some issues regarding tensioning which would likely be resolved by refining the pulley system and having an easier method for tensioning.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Haptic Finger</h2>
                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/rds/mechanical/hfinger.png" alt="" /></span>
                    The haptic finger subsystem recreates human finger dynamics, offering two actively controlled joints (MCP and PIP) plus an additional passive degree of freedom for more 
                    more a more natural range of motion. Stainless steel cables, routed through machined pulleys, maintain precise motion transfer. Cables are tensioned using vented screws 
                    and wing nuts, allowing convenient adjustments and steady performance over time. Similar to other designs Maxon ECX Torque 22XL motors drive the system and are mounted near the palm. The motors
                    are placed in such a way that they do not interfere with the mounting of the haptic thumb.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Haptic Thumb</h2>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/rds/mechanical/thumb.png" alt="" style="width: 400px; height: auto;"/></span>
                    The haptic thumb subsystem attempts to emulate the range of motion for the human thumb with only 2 driven degrees of freed. Similar to the robot thumb it offers 'waggle' and 'curl' motions enhanced by an additional passive degree of freedom. Cable 
                    tension is managed via a series of idler pulleys and vented fasteners to achieve smooth, consistent engagement. Maxon ECX motors drive the both the 'waggle' and 'curl' motions, and a rotating
                    fitting allows your thumb to freely swivel within the mechanism. A flexible TPU thimble interface accommodates various thumb sizes while preserving a 
                    secure, ergonomic fit. CNC-machined elements support a sturdy yet lightweight structure. Friction in the cable system occasionally emerges during operation, but we believe this issue could
                    be fixed with higher tolerance pulleys, and a less complex way to tension the cables.
