                    <p>
                        This project, developed as part of Northwestern University's selective capstone program in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory, 
                        focused on designing and implementing a sophisticated haptic-robot telemanipulation system. Argonne National Laboratory desired a system that would allow 
                        their chemists to remotely work with radioactive materials, necessitating a highly precise-yet-strong haptic/robot system. Our solution enables users to control a robotic finger and thumb
                        using a haptic exoskeleton. 
                    </p>

                <h2>System Overview</h2>
                    <p> The mechanical, electrical, and software components of this project were meticulously designed by our team in just five short months, ultimately generating an  approach to human-robot devices with unique advantages.
                        Other haptic/robot hand systems struggle to adequately translate forces between the robot and the user, leaving rigid objects that the robot grasps feeling squishy for the operator.
                        This is problematic if the operator needs to work with precision equipment to manipulate small objects.
                        Common power transfer solutions do not work well in this application; gear-train solutions have backlash which is noticeable to operators, linkages are complex to design and would inhibit a 
                        low-profile design, and pneumatic/hydraulic systems struggle to match  the force that the human hand can produce. To bypass these issues, we opted for a cable driven design 
                        powered by brushless DC motors that sit near the operator's palm. Doing this, we were able to remove any play in the system and keep the mechanical design both slender and strong. 
                        The cables allowed us to design core functionality revolving around a high gain controller, giving the operator an accurate representation of whatever the robot is interacting with.
                        The system is comprised of distinct haptic and robotic elements for both fingers and thumbs, each equipped with two actuated degrees of 
                        freedom, and a third passive degree of freedom, allowing natural and precise motion while maintaining a feasible design within the project time frame. <br> <br>
                        I worked to design a modular electrical system for these robot and haptic devices, ultimately developing 3 different PCBs which handled the power, communication, and control of each subsystem. 
                        Power is supplied through a custom-designed PCB dubbed the 'power board', providing 4 distinct power domains and stable voltage regulation with multiple user and system protections integrated. The 'data board' 
                        facilitates real-time communication via a dual CAN bus architecture, managed by a Teensy microcontroller and fault-tolerant 
                        transceivers, enabling data exchange across subsystems. High-resolution magnetic encoders provide critical feedback for motion control, while safety mechanisms, including 
                        emergency stops and system monitoring, safeguard the operator and hardware.

                    The robot finger subsystem serves as a mechanical analog to a human finger, capable of mimicking natural curl motions through its two actively actuated degrees of freedom. A pulley-based 
                    transmission system provides a 4:1 gear ratio at each joint, ensuring high torque and smooth motion. The system is powered by high-performance Maxon EC 45 flat motors, which deliver the torque 
                    required for precise manipulation while maintaining a compact form factor. The design prioritizes structural integrity, with components fabricated using a combination of water jet cutting and 
                    CNC milling techniques. Stainless steel cables serve as the primary transmission medium, tensioned using screws and nuts to ensure consistent performance under varying loads. Magnetic encoders 
                    are integrated for accurate positional feedback, enabling precise control of joint movements. While the subsystem demonstrates high torque efficiency and reliable performance, challenges persist 
                    in coupling the linkages and streamlining the assembly process. Future improvements could include integrating compact gearboxes or modular components to enhance assembly speed and reduce weight.

                    The robot thumb subsystem closely emulates human thumb kinematics, featuring two actuated degrees of freedom that enable waggle and curl motions. 
                    The waggle joint achieves a 7.33:1 transmission ratio using Maxon ECX Torque 22XL motors, ensuring smooth and powerful actuation. The coupled curl joints, operating at a 7.94:1 ratio, 
                    are actuated by Maxon EC 45 FLAT motors, known for their compact design and high torque efficiency. The subsystem utilizes a robust cable-driven mechanism with multiple wraps and tensioning 
                    blocks to maintain precise motion under high loads. Key components, including pulleys and tensioning assemblies, are CNC-machined for accuracy and durability. Manufacturing processes, such as 
                    turning and milling, are employed to achieve tight tolerances, ensuring reliable coupling between mechanical components. While the design achieves its functional goals, future improvements could 
                    focus on minimizing friction in the cable-driven mechanism and optimizing the coupling between waggle and curl motions to enhance overall efficiency and ease of assembly.

                <h2>Haptic Devices</h2>

                <h3>Haptic Finger</h3>

                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/rds/mechanical/hfinger.png" alt=""  style="width: 600px; height: auto;"/></span>
                    The haptic finger subsystem replicates the kinematics of a human finger, enabling two actively controlled degrees of freedomâ€”Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP)â€”while also 
                    accommodating one passive degree of freedom for natural motion. The design employs a robust cable-driven transmission system, where stainless steel cables are routed through precision pulleys to 
                    achieve smooth actuation. To maintain optimal tension, the cables are terminated using vented screws and wing nuts, offering both reliability and ease of maintenance. The motors selected for this 
                    subsystem are Maxon ECX Torque 22XL, chosen for their exceptional torque output, high efficiency, and compact design. Magnetic encoders provide real-time positional feedback, ensuring precise 
                    motion tracking for enhanced haptic interaction. The subsystem is designed for modularity and ease of repair, featuring CNC-machined aluminum components for durability and weight reduction. 
                    However, the routing of cables remains complex and can be further optimized to simplify assembly and maintenance procedures. Future iterations may explore integrating linear actuators to reduce 
                    the dependency on cable tensioning systems.

                <h3>Haptic Thumb</h3>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/rds/mechanical/thumb.png" alt=""  style="width: 400px; height: auto;"/></span>
                    The haptic thumb subsystem is designed to facilitate intricate thumb movements, including waggle (abduction/adduction) and curl (flexion/extension). These two degrees of freedom are actively actuated, 
                    while an additional passive degree of freedom enhances user comfort during operation. The curl motion leverages a cable-driven mechanism with multiple idler pulleys and vented screws to maintain cable 
                    tension. The waggle joint employs compact Maxon ECX motors for precise actuation and low inertia, optimizing performance for dynamic tasks. The modular thimble interface, made from flexible TPU material, 
                    accommodates a wide range of thumb sizes while ensuring a secure and comfortable fit for users. The subsystem is designed to be lightweight and ergonomic, with CNC-machined components that contribute to 
                    its durability and precision. However, cable friction during motion remains a challenge, necessitating further refinement in cable routing and pulley design. Future iterations may introduce additional 
                    active degrees of freedom to replicate the complex movements of the thumb tip, enhancing the subsystemâ€™s overall dexterity.
